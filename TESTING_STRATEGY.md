# Testing Strategy for Open Kahoot

## Overview

Based on the analysis of your codebase, this document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for your Kahoot-like game application. The application has a well-structured modular architecture with distinct managers for different game aspects.

## Architecture Analysis

Your application consists of:

### Server Architecture
- **`server.ts`**: Entry point with Next.js + Socket.IO integration
- **`GameServer.ts`**: Main coordinator managing all game operations
- **Manager Classes**: Modular approach with specialized responsibilities

### Core Managers
1. **`GameManager.ts`**: Game lifecycle, PIN generation, game storage
2. **`PlayerManager.ts`**: Player operations, scoring, leaderboards
3. **`QuestionManager.ts`**: Question flow, statistics, personal results
4. **`TimerManager.ts`**: Timer operations for game phases
5. **`EventHandlers.ts`**: Socket.IO event handling

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests (Jest)

**Priority: HIGH** - These form the foundation of your testing strategy.

#### GameManager Tests
- âœ… Game creation with unique PINs
- âœ… Game lookup by PIN/ID
- âœ… Game state management
- âœ… Edge cases (duplicate PINs, invalid IDs)

#### PlayerManager Tests
- âœ… Player joining/leaving mechanics
- âœ… Score calculations with time bonuses
- âœ… Answer submission validation
- âœ… Reconnection logic
- âœ… Leaderboard generation

#### QuestionManager Tests
- Question progression logic
- Statistics calculation accuracy
- Personal result calculations
- Progress tracking

#### TimerManager Tests
- âœ… Timer creation/deletion
- âœ… Callback execution
- âœ… Multiple timer management
- âœ… Cleanup operations

### 2. Integration Tests (Jest + Socket.IO)

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Test component interactions.

#### GameServer Integration
- âœ… Manager coordination
- âœ… Complete game flow
- âœ… Resource cleanup on shutdown

#### Socket Event Integration
- Event handler workflows
- Real-time communication flows
- Error propagation

### 3. Socket.IO Event Tests

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Test real-time functionality.

#### Event Workflows
- Game creation â†’ Player joining â†’ Game play
- Host disconnection/reconnection
- Player disconnection/reconnection
- Timer synchronization across clients

### 4. End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Test complete user workflows.

#### Complete Game Flows
- âœ… Host creates game â†’ Players join â†’ Complete session
- âœ… Player reconnection scenarios
- âœ… Error handling (invalid PINs, etc.)

#### Browser Compatibility
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile responsive testing

### 5. Performance Tests

**Priority: LOW** - Test under load.

#### Load Testing
- Multiple concurrent games
- High player count per game
- Timer accuracy under load
- Memory usage patterns

## Test Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- Basic testing infrastructure (Jest, Playwright)
- Unit tests for core managers
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Test coverage reporting

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Socket.IO event testing
- Component integration tests

### ðŸ“‹ TODO
- Performance/load testing
- Mobile-specific E2E tests
- Socket.IO stress testing

## Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# End-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# All tests (in CI)
npm run test && npm run test:e2e
```

## CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow includes:

1. **Unit Tests**: Run on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
2. **Linting**: ESLint checks
3. **Type Checking**: TypeScript compilation
4. **Coverage**: Codecov integration
5. **E2E Tests**: Playwright on multiple browsers

## Test Coverage Goals

- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage for manager classes
- **Integration Tests**: 80%+ coverage for critical paths
- **E2E Tests**: 100% coverage of primary user flows

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent
2. **Mocking**: Mock external dependencies (timers, sockets)
3. **Cleanup**: Proper cleanup after each test
4. **Descriptive Names**: Clear test descriptions
5. **Edge Cases**: Test error conditions and edge cases

## Potential Testing Challenges

1. **Timer-based Logic**: Use Jest fake timers for consistent testing
2. **Socket.IO Events**: Mock socket connections for unit tests
3. **Real-time Coordination**: E2E tests need careful timing
4. **State Management**: Ensure proper cleanup between tests

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install testing packages
2. **Run Unit Tests**: Start with `npm test` to run existing unit tests
3. **Add Socket Tests**: Implement Socket.IO event testing
4. **Setup E2E**: Configure Playwright for your UI components
5. **Monitor Coverage**: Use coverage reports to identify gaps

## Tools Used

- **Jest**: Unit and integration testing
- **@testing-library**: React component testing utilities
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing
- **GitHub Actions**: Continuous integration
- **Codecov**: Coverage reporting

This testing strategy provides a solid foundation for maintaining code quality as your project grows.
